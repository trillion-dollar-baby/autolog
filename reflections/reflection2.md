## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we did excellent on working on all features and putting everything together exactly as we have the design on the wireframe. We also fixed all the bugs we were having and it was tackled by collaborating together and researching together

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges our group faced this week was to have a responsive website for different screen sizes as in smaller screen sizes the styling was not suitable and creating small but important features for a clean UI such as the category dropdown was hard to achieve as we wanted it to be 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we were able to finish all of our tasks for Sprint 2 and are in the process of planning how to organize Sprint 3. We believe our strong organization and communication allowed us to get our MVP done for the week, and as long as we maintain that we will be able to implement all of the stretch features for Sprint 3.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

After having all the pieces polished and ready to be joined together created by a combination of knowledge of all the things we have learned along this journey, it definitely helped me to make the process of connecting and debugging any errors while doing so really easy and not too time-consuming, getting ahead of the deadline and also working in some stretch features such as fixing styling and toasts. 

Some of the labs where we had to connect the backend with the frontend, matching naming conventions, and normalizing data before inserting into the database as it was done in some teaching lessons from resources provided, was really helpful in terms of giving us a hint of what we were missing and helped us to debug problems we were having when performing item and user updates.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A possible user story at risk is the manager user role, as they have a lot of power just like the owner would, so it would be better to allow for the manager to request for access to the database but not have power to delete it. We believe the other roles are distinguished enough to implement, and we will thus begin with the employee role. 

In terms of stretch features, we believe we can accomplish all the features we have in mind. These features include having a relog feature that would go off if the user has been inactive for a certain time period (which would improve security) and setting an order system to let shops know what items have been ordered but in transit vs what has already arrived. As forementioned, one feature we think will possibly take longer is the permissions feature and so to account for the complexity of it, we are opting to make 3 user roles instead of the 4 we originally had in mind.
