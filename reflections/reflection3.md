## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing abou this week is that we managed to finish all the core features in time in what we had in the sprint with only missing polishing features and adding the final two features which will be hardly worked over the weekend

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week the hardest thing was to plan everything out before executing while measuring the time accordingly to the features we wanted to implement versus what was possible to accomplish to have a solid presentation while still innovating with groundbreaking features for the application

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to complete all of the tasks we assigned in our sprint planning, but after the feedback we received today during demo day, we also decided to continue working on updating features for better user experience this weekend until our week at workday. We are now prioritizing making sure we have the accessibility we want, as this was something we didn't follow all the way through with. In particular, we would like to make sure all of the features look and are as accessible as we deem them to so that way our users can understand our site like we do.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 We didn't necessarily utilize all of the resources provided, we mostly relied on our own research. But we did find resources like the heroku and surge guide useful. We did experiment with the way we deployed our app for a while, and did ultimately follow through with heroku and surge as required, but were debating about deploying on netlify as an option, thinking about how to best make use of having our site displayed. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Even though we already have everything we wanted since the beginning, the only features we are missing is the Purchase and Invoice system. These features are something we really want to accomplish to have not just something to showcase but to be actually used in real life and it is going as expected but roadblocks may happen anytime so we branched out the latest stable build that is just missing polishing features and the experimental branch that will feature the new two systems just in case to not compromise our stable application that will be used to showcase it in future demos.
